# Tags: a core concept to understand

openBOS&reg; offers high level API endpoints with ontology namespace, but everything is organized internally with tags. The ontology is based on a complete information 
model that describes the information and contextualizes it. This mechanism is based on standard tags that may be used for interoperability between applications.
Basic objects are the same and they are contextualized with a list of tags you may access via an API endpoints per object. 

Example: a floor object is basically a zone object but with the tag "bos:space:structure:floor". 

It is important to understand and study the tag mechanism.

The standard tags of openBOS&reg; start with &ldquo;bos:&rdquo;.

You may may add your own tags and use the tag management and filtering engine to handle your information.

The parameters of objects may also be enriched via tags.
