# Several levels of accessibility


The openBOS&reg; API offers two namespaces (REST / JSON) depending how deep you as a developer want to dive into the solution. We are offering you:

1.	**Ontology namespace:** you find here the high level API endpoints and simple schema objects  in order to start services on basic functions of  openBOS&reg;. 
These are very useful to start an application and see the power of openBOS&reg;. All API endpoints of this namespace contain "api/v1/ontology".
It publishes property, buildings, structures, zones, spaces, assets, alarms, ...

2.	**Core namespace:** you find here deeper API endpoints and you dive more into the kernel of the ontology. It is useful when you  want to use the whole power of the ontology: 
All API endpoints of this namespace contain "api/v1/core".
For instance, you may use core namespaces when you want to create or modify the ontology. This extended API is not published; please [contact us](mailto:it.el.electrification.digital@abb.com) for further information.

This documentation focuses on the ***ontology*** namespace of our openBOS&reg;.
