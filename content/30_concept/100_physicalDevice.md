# Physical device management


The ontology also describes the physical devices and their interfaces: the control command functions, their address, their protocol, their channel, their location in the ontology, ...

Devices are the physical devices that are installed inside the building and connected to the network. The openBOS&reg; ontology allows to read, write and subscribe to value changes of the datapoints associated with a device.

Here again all is template-based and a device template is created. All the identical devices instances are linked to that device template.
