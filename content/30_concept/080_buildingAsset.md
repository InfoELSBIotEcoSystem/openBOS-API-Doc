# Building&apos;s asset management


In each zone or space there are assets (lamps, button fan, coil, ...) called functional blocks (FB). These functional blocks may belong to one or several 
zones and/or spaces and/or structures, ...

You see there are several possible API endpoints: either browse the structure and find the zones and the asset, or browse the collection of assets and find the 
zones and spaces within.
