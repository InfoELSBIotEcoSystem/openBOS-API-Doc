# Device management

openBOS® ontology also describes the physical devices and their interfaces: the control command functions, their address, their protocol, their channel, their location in the ontology, … 

Devices are the physical device that are wired inside the building and connected in networks. They manage assets and offer automated functions inside a building. openBOS® ontology offers routes to access the collection of ASSET it manages, but also routes to read, write, subscribe to value change of the datapoints that are in the device. 

Here again all is template based and a device template is created. All the identical devices instances are linked to that device template
