# Introduction to openBOS&reg; for developers

openBOS&reg; is a Building Operating System: a software platform that establishes the link between any equipment of a building and 
the applications that will be used by building managers and building occupants. openBOS&reg; is to buildings what Android&trade; is to smartphones.

openBOS&reg; centralizes data from different sources: building management systems, lighting, HVAC, electrical distribution, 
emergency lighting, EV charging, access control, parking, wireless IoT sensors... to unify, structure and enrich them in a single
 repository. That information is technics free, organized in buildings, stories, roofs, spaces and zones and published in Web services 
 for service providers to develop applications.
Services are applications developed on  top of the openBOS&reg; API to bring a new value proposition based on the structured and qualified 
information delivered by openBOS&reg;. These services may be located on premises in the Building edge that on which openBOS&reg; is running or they 
may be located in the cloud: The 
API is unique and only a single development is needed for both deployments.

openBOS&reg; is a true operating system: you may connect to any device from any brand and may develop any service on  top of it. It 
embeds standard protocols (BACnet, Modbus, SNMP, KNX, LonWorks, â€¦) but it also offers a Driver Development Kit if you use a protocol that is not yet implemented. Of course, any developed application may immediately and at no change interface with these devices. That is the beauty of the operating system.

Several different systems exist to control heating, ventilation, lighting, access control, etc. 
These large amounts of heterogeneous data need to be organized if they are to contribute to cost-efficient and environmentally 
friendly real estate management. Up to now, this was often a nightmare for developers to interface with a collection of systems, APIs and 
data models. **We offer a Cloud API to serve information of a unified building ontology; the result is openBOS&reg; ontology.**

Most modern buildings have indeed an existing smart potential but are not unified. Designed with sensor-rich environments, 
they have the capacity to run more efficiently and sustainably than ever before while responding in real time to the needs of 
inhabitants. Current building systems are operating in silos, solving tasks independently within their own systems and building data models 
and APIs.

openBOS&reg; ontology solves that problem by unifying the information and publishing it in a simple and structured way. 
**No need to parse several APIs of several building systems: openBOS&reg; offers a unified Cloud services API that describes 
a property, meaning one or a collection of buildings in a single location.**

The connection to the ontology is cyber-secure, API endpoints are self-explanatory and objects are non-technical and usage-oriented: you 
navigate in buildings, floors, offices, lamps, ... you manage physical devices, physical points, assets of the building, ... 
you control the command automation of the property: alarms, schedule and trending values. You also define the user ecosystem, and 
everything is based on templates.
